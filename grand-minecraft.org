#+TITLE: Vanilla Minecraft improving project -- possibly ideal
* What Minecraft needs
Minecraft is a game that inspires players -- let them make their own fun -- about creativity
But there has to be some designs:
Puzzle solving -- I will say there are two types of puzzles or challenges: strategic and action (real-time)

Real-time puzzles requires some kind of failure
So I will focus on the survival experience (survival is against death or failure): mobs and combat (maybe by building)
Relaxation and tension: Day and night but the time length may not be fixed
If not exploring there could be no challenges i.e. freedom of engaging in challenges

Derived ideas:
- difficulty parameter, random day night lengths
- Challenges come from darkness, so the earth model (flat earth, air above ground, caves underground) is good
  But there have to be limited light sources (we struggle to get light, so light is temporary)
- In overworld, you have to get through multiple days and nights to get surely out of danger -- the first eternal light
  to build the first shelter
  you can't use build techniques to get out of danger from darkness
  - Spawning strong mobs in dark limited space in player's sight
  - different speeds of mobs, firstly try random; no sprinting, shields
  - avoidable arrows but limiting your movements
  - mobs that can go across heights and that can destory blocks (creeper which doesn't lose track)
  - larger amount of mobs
- And in another dimension e.g. nether, you will get more eternal light but nether has a lot of travelling problems
- Build speed > destruction speed

- If you feel that is too slow-paced there can be maps that has already been progressed
